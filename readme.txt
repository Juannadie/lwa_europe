*Code Files in R are prepared to read sequentially 

*They are set to run if data files (EU-SILC personal files (P) in .dta format) are in the same directory set as working directory. Note EU-SILC data files are not provided, and must be obtained from Eurostat.

*We have used Eurostat 2020 release of 2018 data (https://doi.org/10.2907/EUSILC2004-2018V.1)

* Other additional files (essentiality and closure scores and teleworking indices) are provided and must also be placed in the same working directory (or else a different path should be stated when loading the file in the code, of course)

* Code in Stata has been provided additionally for the main step 3 of calculating the Lockdown Ability Index and the wage loss in different scenarios.
